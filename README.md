# Mixed Reality Tabletop Game for Meta Quest 3

Welcome to the Mixed Reality Unity Game App repository! This project brings your physical space to life by spawning interactive 3D assets onto detected tables in a room, using the Meta Quest 3â€™s room-scanning capabilities.

## ðŸŸ¢ Features

- **Room Scanning:** Utilizes Meta Quest 3â€™s sensors to detect tables in the environment.
- **3D Asset Spawning:** Dynamically places objects onto detected surfaces.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Assets/**: Unity project assets, including 3D models, textures, and scripts.
- **Scenes/**: Pre-configured Unity scenes for testing and deployment.
- **Scripts/**: C# scripts handling object spawning, physics, and interactions.
- **Builds/**: Contains a sample compiled APK for easy installation.
- **Documentation/**: Additional setup guides and API references.
