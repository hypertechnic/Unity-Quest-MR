# Mixed Reality Tabletop Development for Meta Quest 3

This is a learning demonstration project created to understand the Unity ecosystem and how to develop with it for the Meta Quest 3. The simple project used a scanned room, and spawns a "Grabbable King" object onto detected horizontal tables. That object is interactable, and respects physics. I learned most of these techniques from YouTuber Ludic Worlds, with this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWcLPdrF6kOno_LNP846xfzeWYl5h6S5I

## ðŸŸ¢ Features

- **Room Scanning:** Utilizes Meta Quest 3â€™s sensors to detect tables in the environment.
- **3D Asset Spawning:** Dynamically places objects onto detected surfaces.
- **Physics Integration:** Objects respond to gravity and interact with each other and the environment.
- **Interaction Support:** Engage with spawned assets using Meta Quest controllers.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- **Assets/**: Unity project assets, including 3D models, textures, and scripts.
- **Scenes/**: Pre-configured Unity scenes for testing and deployment.
- **Scripts/**: C# scripts handling object spawning, physics, and interactions.
- **Builds/**: Contains a sample compiled APK for easy installation.
- **Documentation/**: Additional setup guides and API references.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hypertechnic/Unity-Quest-MR.git
   ```

2. **Open in Unity:**
   - Use Unity Hub to open the project (Unity version compatible with Meta Quest development).

3. **Set Up for Meta Quest 3:**
   - Install the necessary Oculus/Meta Quest SDK.
   - Enable XR support in Unity settings.

4. **Build & Deploy:**
   - Connect your Meta Quest 3 headset.
   - Build and run the project, or install the provided APK from the `root` folder.
   - Note, you will need your own driver library files (auto generated by Unity) to run this app.

## ðŸ“² Installing the APK

1. Connect Meta Quest 3 to your PC.
2. Enable Developer Mode on the headset.
3. Use ADB to install the APK:
   ```sh
   adb install path/to/Joe_MR.apk
   ```
